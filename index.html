				<h1>NIPAP</h1>
				<p>The Neat IP Address Planner</p>

				<p>NIPAP is the coolest address planner out there with an awesome and blazingly fast search. IPv4 and IPv6 are equals in NIPAP - that is, complete feature parity exist for the two address families. Assigning new addresses is as easy as 1 2 3 with the integrated and easy-to-use address pool assignment features.</p>

				<p>If you wish to integrate your own system with NIPAP, fear not, for NIPAP is built with a simple XML-RPC middleware. Both the web and CLI interact with the database through the XML-RPC API to 100%, guaranteeing that any feature available via the regular interfaces are also available to you.</p>
				<h2>Screenshots</h2>
				Here's a couple of screenshots from a test deployment.

				<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.0em; font-weight: bold;">A listing of schemas</p>
				<a href="screenshots/schema-list.png"><img src="screenshots/schema-list.png" width="780px"></a>
				<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">Schemas are roughly equal to a VRF in a router. Prefixes are unique inside each schema, so schemas typically represent a VRF but can also be used just to group addresses for whatever reason.</p>

				<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.0em; font-weight: bold;">Creating a new address pool.</p>
				<a href="screenshots/new-pool.png"><img src="screenshots/new-pool.png" width="780px"></a>
				<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">Address pools (or prefix pools rather) can be used to group a number of prefixes together from which you can later assign new prefixes. The size of the new prefix as well as the 'type' (a NIPAP internal attribute) can be inherited from the address pool. Do note how a pool handles both IPv4 and IPv6 seamlessly.</p>

				<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.0em; font-weight: bold;"> Creating a new prefix from an address pool</p>
				<a href="screenshots/new-prefix-from-pool.png"><img src="screenshots/new-prefix-from-pool.png" width="780px"></a>
				<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">For speedy assignment of new addresses, the user can request one from a pre-defined pool. This allows the end-user to be oblivious of which prefix he should pick his new assignment from, instead he can choose a pool and just get a prefix automatically assigned. An IP registry adminitrator can make sure that the pools don't run out of addresses.</p>

				<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.0em; font-weight: bold;">Prefix search</p>
				<a href="screenshots/search.png"><img src="screenshots/search.png" width="780px"></a>
				<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">A typical search. Matching prefixes are in black, grey prefixes are included for context. Notice the indentation for further helping the user understand the prefix structure.</p>

				<h2>Documentation</h2>
				<p>The source code of NIPAP is not overly complex and is fairly well documented making it overall rather easy to understand. Sphinx is used to generate pretty HTML pages directly from the source code which you can find at the following link:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="nipap/index.html">Reference documentation</a>
					<li><a href="jnipap/index.html">Java API</a>
				</ul>

					<a href="http://python.org"><img src="images/python-powered-w-140x56.png" border="0" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5"></a>The majority of NIPAP (including backend and the C in MVC for web GUI) is written in Python while, naturally, a large part of the web frontend is written in HTML and JavaScript for that special cozy Web2.0 feeling.

					<a href="http://www.postgresql.org"><img src="images/postgresql-powered-95x51_4.gif" border="0" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5"></a>PostgreSQL is the SQL database of choice and without it, this project could never have existed. In particular, there is an add-on called ip4r that adds index functionality to columns used to store IP addresses which is crucial to this project.

					<a href="http://twistedmatrix.com"><img src="images/twisted-200px.png" border="0" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5"></a>Last, but certainly not least, NIPAP uses Twisted which is an event-driven, asynchronous networking engine - perfect for the NIPAP backend.
